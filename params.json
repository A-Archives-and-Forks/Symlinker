Switched to GitHub instead of Google Code since they are going to close soon.\r\n\r\nI will be updating this little app over the course of the next days and hopefully release it in better shape. A lot of people has filed issues with it and I plan to sort them out.\r\n\r\nBetter later than never some might say. I hope that is not too late for this app to get new light.\r\n\r\n*Featured On*:\r\n[addictivetips](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/symlinker-create-symlink-hardlink-and-directory-junction-in-windows/)\r\n\r\nPrevious Project link\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/symlinker/\r\n\r\n[Download ClickOnce Installer](http://alejandro.md/publish/Symlinker/Symlink%20Creator.application)\r\n\r\nIn case the link above does not work download the whole package.\r\n\r\n[Download Package](http://alejandro.md/publish/Symlinker/Symlinker.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWith this utility you can use the symlink application Microsoft Windows has well hidden inside the cmd.exe app.\r\n\r\nThe goal is just make it easier to create symbolic links, hard links, or directory junctions, using a pretty simple interface, so no more bogus command line to do it...\r\n\r\nThis application needs .Net Framework 3.5 to run (SP1 recommended) and as of 7/26/2010 this software will only work under Windows Vista or 7, Windows XP doesn't have the mklink command inside the cmd.exe app. I'll look for a workaround for this, but it isn't promising that I will find it...\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a bug, please let me know in the issues section, I will look into it when I have the time!\r\n\r\nThanks for your downloads and support, hope you like it!\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Get a real certificate\r\n* Rework the code\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n----------\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.1.14 04/22/2015\r\n\r\n    Updated mail contact\r\n    Moved issues from Google Code\r\n    Updated installation link\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.1.10 08/31/2013\r\n\r\n    Uploaded to GitHub\r\n    Added ClickOnce check for updates support, get updates as automatically upon app launch (Still work in progress)\r\n    Minor Changes (Almost nothing)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.1.3 10/30/2010\r\n\r\n    Fixed.
